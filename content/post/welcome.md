Welcome One and All to my experiments...

I'm using this site to document my adventures with my homelab and other interesting information that I run across in the process. 

As of today (March 25, 2024) I don't have a lot of information posted, but I will update this site with what I'm playing with or testing at the moment.

I have posted a list of the physical hardware and software stack of my homelab also, I will try to keep those up to date as things change.

If you find something wrong, you can [contact me here](//mad9scientist.com/about/contact/) - on my main site.

This is also my first time playing with [Hugo](//gohugo.io), so the design will change as I get use to it.

You can talk to me on [Twitter](//twitter.com/mad9scientist) (It will always be Twitter never X).

&mdash; Chris

P.S. if you find typo and grammar mistakes, I'm sorry this site will be more of a quick note taking tool than a proper site.
