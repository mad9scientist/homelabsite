I discovered an interesting... problem.

Apparently the speaker group will disconnect from Chrome in two cases:

* The audio stream has few minutes of no audio out
* between 20-24 hours the connection will drop

So I have to access the console of the Virtual Machine to reconnect Chrome to the Speaker Group.

It's annoying but not a deal breaker - just annoying.

I thought I would post an update to let anyone else know that Chromecast has a 20-24 hour connection limit.
